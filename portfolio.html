                    <p>
                      A web application to monitor
                      real-time football statistics and trading market prices to be used
                      as a tool for football traders. The bulk of the product is the live
                      view that takes in-play statistics from an external API, breaks this
                      down into minute-by-minute events and displays the data in both grid
                      and graph forms. There are also custom algorithms that can determine
                      team pressure and "HOT & COLD" games. The system also features a
                      custom filter builder that can be used to send messages to a users
                      mobile device if any games have met a specific criteria. This
                      product has been built using a Node.js backend and a React/Redux
                      frontend. (BTW, the marketing site was not made by me)

                    <p>An offline-first mobile application for both iOS and Android used to collect leads at live events using different methods of capture: manual entry, business card transcription, event badge scanning and NFC scanning.</p>
                    <p>A key feature of the application is it's ability to function offline, as the wifi at live events can often be unreliable, which enables users to capture their important leads and sync the data back when a reliable connection can be found. Users can also capture partially complete records and complete them later, allowing them to maintain focus on a potential sales lead rather than spending that valuable time entering qualification data.</p>
