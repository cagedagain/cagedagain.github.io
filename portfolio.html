                  <p>I have been filled with steam for months, for years Same old cloud, claustrophobic me Let it burst like old train sounds Make them leave me nature. On the surface simplicity Swirling black lilies totally ripe But the darkest pit in me It's pagan poetry Swirling black lilies totally ripe Pagan poetry. Soothe me. Get over that sorrow, girl. Enjoy.</p>

                  <p>Through the warmthest Cord of care Your love was sent to me. I tip-toe down to the shore stand by the ocean make it roar at me and i roar back. In the sleeping curves of my body Shall enter fingers Of smooth mastery With chasteness of sea-girls Will I complete the mystery Of my flesh Will I complete the mystery Of my flesh My flesh. With a razorblade  I'll cut a slit open And the luminous beam Feeds you honey, heals you. Shower of goodness coming to End the doubt pouring over Shower of goodness coming to end.</p>

Understand So clearly To shut yourself up Would be the hugest crime of them all You're just crying after all To not want them humans around Anymore. I tip-toe down to the shore stand by the ocean make it roar at me and i roar back. You can't say no to hope  You can't say no to happiness. It's. oh. so quiet it's. oh. so still you're all alone and so peaceful until....</p>
