          <h1>Full Stack Developer</h1>
          <h2>Contract Work</h2>
          <h4>May 2019 - July 2019</h4>
          <p>
            I was brought into a 2 month contract to prepare an online seller of
            live tickets for a large on-sale promotion that would see their
            active user count jump from approximately 20 at once to 100,000 for
            a single day. Because of the short period of the increase in users
            there wasn’t a need to have an architecture that can support this
            high a number of users throughout the year, so I employed various
            different techniques to ensure the website wouldn’t go down during
            this period that could also be enabled for any future on-sales
            without the huge financial burden of running an unnecessarily large
            server architecture.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Profiling both the PHP website and the Node API and making any
              necessary code optimisations
            </li>
            <li>
              Improving the implementation and increasing the use of the Redis
              cache
            </li>
            <li>
              Building a local cache of responses from external APIs to reduce
              time spent loading external information, with the ability to
              invalidate a single request response if up-to-date information
              necessary
            </li>
            <li>
              Building a static mimic of the live website that could be
              delivered by AWS CloudFront in the event of errors, powered by the
              local cache

          <h1>Engineering Manager</h1>
          <h2>Akkroo (now Integrate Events)</h2>
          <h4>December 2016 - May 2019</h4>
          <p>
            After building the team to 5 members I officially moved into a
            management role and away from hands-on development responsibilities.
            This ensured that the growing team had dedicated management to
            enable them to perform at their best. The team consisted of 9
            on-site developers and 2 remote system administrators.
          </p>
          <p>My key responsibilities included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Building a strong culture of feedback
            </li>
            <li>
              Supporting career development through goals, 1 to 1s, coaching and
              mentoring
            </li>
            <li>
              Recruiting and continuing to develop a team of great people
            </li>
            <li>
              Constantly improving productivity & best practices with the team
            </li>
            <li>
              Enabling the team to deliver as efficiently as possible
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>

          <h1>Full Stack Developer</h1>
          <h2>Akkroo (now Integrate Events)</h2>
          <h4>September 2014 - December 2016</h4>
          <p>
            I joined Akkroo as the second developer when the company had a total
            of 6 members and was involved in all areas of the technical
            development and maintenance of a SaaS product. The tech stack
            included PHP, Javascript (vanilla and ReactJS), Cordova, MongoDB,
            MySQL, AWS and Linux. I was also responsible for all server
            maintenance and hiring to continue the growth of the team. As
            expected in a startup that’s still finding Product-Market fit, this
            was a challenging but incredibly exciting and rewarding role.

          <h1>PHP Analyst Programmer</h1>
          <h2>ITRM</h2>
          <h4>June 2012 - September 2014</h4>
          <p>
            I joined the small ITRM web agency team as a full stack developer
            mostly working with PHP and Javascript. I was responsible for
            developing and maintaining a large in-house bespoke CMS built using
            Codeigniter, which was used for anything from small, responsive
            websites to Intranets with large user bases, and a simple to use CRM
            system (Laravel) which was, again, used in a variety of different
            scale projects. I also built multiple individual bespoke systems
            integrated with various public APIs (Google Maps, Foursquare,
            Twitter, Facebook). I also performed various administrative tasks
            supporting the development and production MySQL and LAMP stack
            server setups.

          <h1>IT Support</h1>
          <h2>Fusion People</h2>
          <h4>January 2008 - January 2009</h4>
          <p>
            Responsible for providing IT support to 250+ recruitment agents
            using various Windows operating systems. Also required to manage
            personal time and workload efficiently to ensure that all errors and
            queries were dealt with in a professional manner and in accordance
            with company policies. Other responsibilities included: updating and
            general housekeeping of MS SQL Server database, liaising with
            external suppliers (phone companies, manufacturers etc), testing of
            internal software projects.

          <h1>Use Judgement</h1>
          <h2>Akkroo Values Award</h2>
          <h4>2017</h4>
          <p>
            In 2017 Akkroo introduced it’s own annual awards with each award
            dedicated to one of the company values (Make an Impact, Use
            Judgement, Be Curious & Innovate, Build Trust and Embrace the
            Journey). I was awarded the ‘Use Judgement’ award for being the
            first in the company to move from being an individual contributor
            into a management role and the decisions made to ensure that it was
            successful for both myself and the rest of the company.
